See that heart?
That is your SOUL,
the very culmination of your being!

Your SOUL starts to weak, but can grow strong if you gain a lot of LV.

Why, LOVE, of course!

You want some LOVE, don't you?

Don't worry, I'll share some with you

Little white...
"firendliness pellets."

In this world, it's kill or BE killed.

Toriel:
What a terrible creature, torturing such a poor, innocent youth...
---
Ah, do not be afraid, my child.
---
I am TORIEL, caretaker of the RUINS.
---
I pass through this place every day to see if anyone has fallen down.
---
You are the first human to come here in a long time.
---
Come!
I will guide you through the catacombs.
{normal}

Toriel:

* This way.

[after some walking with toriel]

* Welcome to your new home, innocent one.
---
* Allow me to educate you in the operation of the RUINS.

[After flexing on puzzle #1]

* The RUINS are full of puzzles.
---
* Ancient fusions between diversions and doorkeys.
---
* One must solve them to move from room to room.
---
* PLease adjust yourself to the sight of them.
[the stone inscription #1]

* Only the fearless may proceed.
* Brave ones, foolish ones.
* Both walk not the middle road

* Do not worry, I have labelled the ones that you need to flip.

[board that says how to interact with objects.]
